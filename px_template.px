<p>This is a presentation I gave at <a href='http://bostonpython.com'>Boston Python</a> in April of 2012.</p>

<p>There's a <a href='http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/22100783'>video of me talking</a>, but you can't read the slides
in it, so you might want to follow along here.
Also, clicking the slide images on this page will jump into the full presentation at that point.</p>
